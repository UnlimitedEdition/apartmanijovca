      "title": "About Us – Welcome to Jovča Apartments",
      "content": "Our apartments are located on the shore of the beautiful Bovan Lake, a hidden gem nestled between three mountains – Bukovik, Ozren, and Rtanj. The lake is about 8 km long and 900 meters wide at its widest point, surrounded by forests and untouched nature. This place is known for the 'rose of winds' – gentle air currents that refresh and have a beneficial effect on the respiratory and nervous systems. Here you will find peace, health, and tranquility that you can rarely experience elsewhere. Nearby, you can enjoy a rich selection of excursions: Soko Banja (15 km), the ethno-village of Vrmdža with a small lake (6 km), a horse stud farm in the village of Mozgovo, an Aqua Park in Jagodina (60–70 km), and historical monuments in Niš – the Red Cross camp, Bubanj, Mediana, and Čegar (55 km). Lovers of spiritual peace can visit the Church of St. Roman and numerous monasteries just 10–15 km away. Jovča Apartments are a true paradise for swimming, fishing, and boating, and the surrounding nature creates the perfect backdrop for unforgettable moments. With us, you will find the ideal combination of relaxation, nature, and opportunities to explore the area."
